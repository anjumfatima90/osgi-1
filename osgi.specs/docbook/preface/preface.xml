    <title>Implementation Requirements</title>

    <para>An implementation of a Specification: (i) must fully implement the
    Specification including all its required interfaces and functionality;
    (ii) must not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the OSGi Name
    Space, or include any public or protected packages, classes, Java
    interfaces, fields or methods within the OSGi Name Space other than those
    required and authorized by the Specification. An implementation that does
    not satisfy limitations (i)-(ii) is not considered an implementation of
    the Specification and must not be described as an implementation of the
    Specification. "OSGi Name Space" shall mean the public class or interface
    declarations whose names begin with "org.osgi" or any recognized
    successors or replacements thereof. An implementation of a Specification
    must not claim to be a compatible implementation of the Specification
    unless it passes the Technology Compatibility Kit ("TCK") for the
    Specification.</para>
