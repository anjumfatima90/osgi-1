/**
 * Device Service Specification for ZigBee Technology Descriptors.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This package contains the interfaces representing the ZigBee descriptors and
 * the fields defined inside some of them.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An interface for modeling the ZigBee User Descriptor is missing because this
 * descriptor has only one field (the UserDescription). Therefore this field can
 * be read and written using respectively the
 * {@link org.osgi.service.zigbee.ZigBeeNode#getUserDescription()} and the
 * {@link org.osgi.service.zigbee.ZigBeeNode#setUserDescription(String)}
 * methods.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.osgi.service.zigbee.descriptors.ZigBeeNodeDescriptor}, 
 * {@link org.osgi.service.zigbee.descriptors.ZigBeePowerDescriptor} and the
 * {@link org.osgi.service.zigbee.descriptors.ZigBeeComplexDescriptor} are read 
 * using the appropriate methods in the
 * {@link org.osgi.service.zigbee.ZigBeeNode} interface, whereas the
 * ZigBeeSimpleDescriptor can be read using the appropriate method of the
 * {@link org.osgi.service.zigbee.ZigBeeEndpoint} services registered in the
 * framework.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Bundles wishing to use this package must list the package in the
 * Import-Package header of the bundle's manifest. This package has two types of
 * users: the consumers that use the API in this package and the providers that
 * implement the API in this package.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example import for consumers using the API in this package:
 * <p>
 * {@code  Import-Package: org.osgi.service.zigbee.descriptors; version="[1.0,2.0)"}
 * <p>
 * Example import for providers implementing the API in this package:
 * <p>
 * {@code  Import-Package: org.osgi.service.zigbee.descriptors; version="[1.0,1.1)"}
 *
