/**
 * Device Service Specification for ZigBee Technology Descriptions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This package contains the interfaces for descriptions. The latter may be used
 * to embed meta information about the ZigBee devices, and in other words a meta
 * description of each device type present in a ZCL profile, or even custom
 * devices.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is not mandatory to provide this meta model for being able to interact
 * with a specific device, but the presence of this meta model would make much
 * easier to implement, for example user interfaces.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Bundles wishing to use this package must list the package in the
 * Import-Package header of the bundle's manifest. This package has two types of
 * users: the consumers that use the API in this package and the providers that
 * implement the API in this package.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example import for consumers using the API in this package:
 * <p>
 * {@code  Import-Package: org.osgi.service.zigbee.descriptions; version="[1.0,2.0)"}
 * <p>
 * Example import for providers implementing the API in this package:
 * <p>
 * {@code  Import-Package: org.osgi.service.zigbee.descriptions; version="[1.0,1.1)"}
 * 
 * @author $Id$
